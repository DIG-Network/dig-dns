# dig-dns runbook

## What it is

`dig-dns` is the local `*.dig` resolver: a DNS responder + HTTP gateway that resolves
`<label>.dig` to DIG store content fetched from a dig-node. Normative contract: `SPEC.md`.

## Local running

**Prereqs:** a stable Rust toolchain (`rustup`), and — for actually serving content — a
reachable dig-node (the local node on `127.0.0.1:9778`, or fall back to `rpc.dig.net`).

**Build + test:**

```sh
cargo build
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo llvm-cov --fail-under-lines 80 --summary-only
```

**Run — CLI:**

```sh
dig-dns label encode <64-hex-store-id>     # -> <base32>.dig
dig-dns label decode <label|host>          # -> <64-hex>
dig-dns config [--json]                     # resolved config
dig-dns serve [--node <URL>]               # run the gateway + DNS responder (Ctrl-C to stop)
dig-dns fetch <host|url> [path] [--json]    # one-shot: resolve a .dig resource + print it
dig-dns doctor [--json]                     # diagnose both paths; nonzero if no path can load
dig-dns install [--node <URL>] [--json]     # register (clean-reinstall) + start the OS service
dig-dns uninstall [--json]                  # stop + deregister the OS service
dig-dns start|stop [--json]                 # start / stop the registered service
dig-dns status [--json]                     # serving? + registered? (nonzero when not serving)
```

**`doctor`** checks each link of both resolution paths independently and prints pass/fail + a
fix hint (exit non-zero when a `.dig` URL cannot load): loopback IP up, DNS responder answers
directly, OS routes `.dig` to the loopback IP (Path A), the gateway answers (Path B, primary vs
`:8053` fallback), the gateway can reach a dig-node, the browser DoH/built-in-resolver policy
(informational — explains Path A bypass), and who holds `:80`. `--json` for machine consumption.
Run it to triage after an install.

**Service (`serve`).** Runs BOTH resolution paths on the dedicated loopback IP:

- **HTTP gateway** — `127.0.0.5:80` (deterministic fallback `127.0.0.5:8053` when `:80` is held
  — logged loudly + reported by `/.dig/health`).
- **DNS responder** — `127.0.0.5:53` (UDP + TCP): `*.dig`/apex → `A 127.0.0.5` (TTL 2s,
  0x20-preserved), `AAAA`/other types → NODATA, non-`.dig` → REFUSED, EDNS0/TC → TCP fallback.

Binding `:53` and `:80` on the dedicated IP requires elevation / `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` and that
`127.0.0.5` be up (the installer, Component B, arranges both). The two paths are **independent**:
if the DNS `:53` bind fails (unprivileged, or `:53` held), `serve` logs a warning and continues
gateway-only (Path B via the PAC still serves `.dig`); `/.dig/health` reports `paths.dns`. For an
unprivileged local run, override the binds:

```sh
DIG_DNS_IP=127.0.0.1 DIG_DNS_HTTP_PORT=8080 DIG_DNS_DNS_PORT=5353 \
  dig-dns serve --node http://localhost:9778
# then, in another shell:
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/.dig/health | jq .          # service state (paths.dns, bound_port)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/.dig/proxy.pac              # PAC (advertises the bound port)
curl -H 'Host: <label>.dig' http://127.0.0.1:8080/        # origin-form (Path A)
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 http://<label>.dig/         # absolute-form proxy (Path B)
dig-dns fetch <label>.dig / --node http://localhost:9778  # curl-free fetch
dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5353 <label>.dig                        # DNS: A 127.0.0.5 (needs BIND tools)
# Windows without BIND tools: Resolve-DnsName -Server 127.0.0.5 <label>.dig
```

Control endpoints (also directly on the IP): `GET /.dig/health` (JSON), `GET /.dig/proxy.pac`
(the PAC with the actually-bound port), `GET /.dig/resolve-probe` (`204`). The gateway is
loopback-only, never an open proxy (a non-`.dig` proxy target → `403`), never tunnels CONNECT,
and never intercepts TLS.

**`http://dig.local` (SPEC §12).** `serve` also ensures, idempotently, that `http://dig.local`
(default `127.0.0.2:80` — the installer's hosts mapping for "the user's own node", #91) reaches
the local dig-node: if something already answers there (dig-node's own best-effort bind, or
dig-dns's own proxy from an earlier start), it does nothing; otherwise it binds a transparent
reverse proxy there, forwarding every request byte-for-byte to `http://localhost:9778` (or the
`--node`/`DIG_NODE_URL` override). A bind failure is logged and retried every 30s — never fatal
to the `.dig` gateway/DNS paths. Override the address for unprivileged local testing:

```sh
DIG_DNS_LOCAL_IP=127.0.0.1 DIG_DNS_LOCAL_PORT=8180 dig-dns serve --node http://localhost:9778
curl http://127.0.0.1:8180/health   # relayed straight through to the node
```

**Acceptance:** per-OS runtime acceptance scripts start `dig-dns serve` on high ports and prove
`doctor` + the control endpoints + open-proxy `403` + bad-host `404` + the DNS responder (no node
needed); set `STORE_LABEL`/`ROOT_LABEL` + `NODE` for the content + pinned-vs-latest checks:
`scripts/acceptance-unix.sh` (macOS/Linux) and `scripts/acceptance-windows.ps1` (Windows). Also
`dig-dns pac [--port N]` prints the PAC file (embedding the actual bound port; probes a running
gateway when `--port` is omitted). The Rust integration tests prove the runtime deterministically
(`tests/gateway_stub_node.rs` — both request forms, SPA, ranges, pinned-vs-latest;
`tests/dns_responder.rs` — UDP+TCP; `tests/doctor_live.rs` — doctor against a live service).

The PAC CLI + README + per-OS acceptance scripts (Phase 5) land next.

**Config** is defaults + environment overrides (see `SPEC.md §7`): `DIG_DNS_IP`,
`DIG_DNS_DNS_PORT`, `DIG_DNS_HTTP_PORT`, `DIG_DNS_HTTP_FALLBACK_PORT`, `DIG_DNS_TLD`,
`DIG_DNS_TTL`, `DIG_NODE_URL` (node endpoint override; empty ⇒ the
`dig.local → localhost:9778 → rpc.dig.net` ladder), and `DIG_DNS_LOCAL_IP`/`DIG_DNS_LOCAL_PORT`
(the ensured `dig.local` reverse-proxy address, default `127.0.0.2:80`, SPEC §12).

## Installing as an OS service

`dig-dns` registers itself as an auto-starting OS service (Windows SCM / Linux systemd / macOS
launchd) that runs `dig-dns serve`. Identity + contract (normative in `SPEC.md §13`):

- **service id** `net.dignetwork.dig-dns` — the SCM name / launchd label / systemd unit
  (`net.dignetwork.dig-dns.service`).
- **Windows display name** `DIG NETWORK: DNS` — shown in the Services console.
- **clean-reinstall** — if the service already exists, `install` does **stop → delete → wait →
  recreate → start** (never reconfigure-in-place), so a re-run never hits `CreateService 1073
  "the specified service already exists"`.

```sh
# Register + start (bakes the resolved config into the service env). Elevate on Windows.
sudo dig-dns install                       # Linux/macOS user-level needs no sudo; shown for parity
dig-dns install --node http://localhost:9778   # pin an explicit upstream node
dig-dns status                             # is it serving? is it registered?
dig-dns stop ; dig-dns start               # control it
dig-dns uninstall                          # stop + deregister
```

Windows (elevated "Run as administrator" console):

```powershell
dig-dns install                            # sc create net.dignetwork.dig-dns … + displayname "DIG NETWORK: DNS"
sc query net.dignetwork.dig-dns            # verify registered/running
dig-dns install                            # re-run is a CLEAN reinstall — NOT a 1073 error
```

Install level: user-level (no elevation) on Linux/macOS; system-level (needs Administrator) on
Windows. The installed Windows service runs the hidden `run-service` entrypoint (the SCM
protocol dispatcher) so the SCM does not kill it with error 1053.

## Native install packages (per OS)

Besides the raw binaries + `dig-dns install`, each release ships a NATIVE OS install package that
registers the service for you (dig_ecosystem #503). The `dig-installer` downloads + runs these; you
can also install them directly. They register the same identity (`net.dignetwork.dig-dns` / "DIG
NETWORK: DNS") and state dir as `dig-dns install`, so the paths are interchangeable.

**Windows — `dig-dns-<ver>-windows-x64.msi`** (elevated):

```powershell
msiexec /i dig-dns-<ver>-windows-x64.msi /qn        # install + register + start the service
sc query net.dignetwork.dig-dns                      # verify (RUNNING)
msiexec /x dig-dns-<ver>-windows-x64.msi /qn         # uninstall (stops + removes the service)
```

Installs `dig-dns.exe` under `C:\Program Files\DIG Network\DIG DNS` (added to PATH), registers the
service running `dig-dns.exe run-service` (auto-start), and creates `C:\ProgramData\DigDns`. A
re-run/upgrade is clean (fixed UpgradeCode + MajorUpgrade). A busy `:53` never wedges the installer.

**macOS — `dig-dns-<ver>-macos-{arm64,x64}.pkg`** (needs admin):

```sh
sudo installer -pkg dig-dns-<ver>-macos-arm64.pkg -target /   # install + bootstrap the LaunchDaemon
sudo launchctl print system/net.dignetwork.dig-dns            # verify
# uninstall (no built-in uninstaller):
sudo launchctl bootout system/net.dignetwork.dig-dns
sudo rm -f /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.dignetwork.dig-dns.plist /usr/local/bin/dig-dns
sudo rm -rf "/Library/Application Support/DigDns"
```

**Ubuntu — `dig-dns_<ver>_amd64.deb`** (via apt.dig.net once ingested, or directly):

```sh
sudo apt-get install ./dig-dns_<ver>_amd64.deb   # install + daemon-reload + enable --now
systemctl status net.dignetwork.dig-dns          # verify
sudo apt-get remove dig-dns                       # uninstall (stop + disable + remove the unit)
```

Installs `/usr/bin/dig-dns` + the systemd unit `net.dignetwork.dig-dns.service` (grants
`CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` for `:53`/`:80`, `StateDirectory=/var/lib/dig-dns`). The `.deb` is a GitHub
release asset that `apt.dig.net` ingests + GPG-signs into the apt repo (#425).

## Deployment / release

Tag-driven, per CLAUDE.md §3.6:

1. A PR to `main` bumps `[package].version` in `Cargo.toml` and passes the CI gate set
   (Rustfmt, Clippy, Test + coverage ≥80%, Build, Lint commit messages, Check version
   increment).
2. On merge to `main`, `.github/workflows/changelog-tag.yml` regenerates `CHANGELOG.md` with
   git-cliff, commits it (`chore(release): vX.Y.Z`), and pushes the `vX.Y.Z` tag — using
   `secrets.RELEASE_TOKEN` (a classic PAT) so the tag triggers the deploy-on-tag workflow and
   the changelog commit is allowed past branch protection.
3. The pushed tag fires `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds the `dig-dns` binary for
   windows-x64 / linux-x64 / macos-arm64 / macos-x64 AND the native install packages (the Windows
   `.msi`, the two macOS `.pkg`s, the Ubuntu `.deb`), smoke-tests each on its runner OS
   (install → verify service registered → uninstall), and attaches them all to a GitHub Release.

**Secrets:** `RELEASE_TOKEN` (repo or org secret) is REQUIRED for the tag-on-merge release to
fire. **Verify a release:** confirm the `vX.Y.Z` tag exists, the `Release dig-dns` run is green,
and the GitHub Release has the four binaries + the native packages (`.msi`, `.pkg` ×2, `.deb`)
attached. The `.deb` is picked up + GPG-signed into the apt repo by `apt.dig.net` (#425).

**Test coverage split (#503):** the packaging manifests (WiX `.wxs`, systemd unit, launchd plist,
`.deb` control metadata) are unit-tested in `cargo test` on every PR (`src/packaging.rs` — asserts
each shipped manifest matches the canonical service id / entrypoint / state dir / capability). The
full per-OS package BUILD + install/verify/uninstall SMOKE test runs in `release.yml` on push to
main + on the tag (GitHub runners give admin/root there). The MSI's service table is also verified
buildable locally with the WiX tool.

**Consumers:** the dig-installer resolves these release binaries and invokes `dig-dns install`
(which self-registers under `net.dignetwork.dig-dns` / "DIG NETWORK: DNS" and clean-reinstalls,
so an installer re-run never hits `CreateService 1073`); the installer's remaining job (Component
B) is OS split-DNS + the loopback alias + browser PAC policy.
